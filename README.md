# My Talks and workshops

This folder contains artifacts from my talks and workshops, most of them being about Gemini, the Gemini APIs or SDKs, or AI Studio.

When we have a YouTube video, I also added a link to the [AI Studio App](https://aistudio.google.com/apps/drive/18XuOzEU1zuseoaPtXrdVUeTY3nNbM80u?fullscreenApplet=true) I built that analyze the talk and give me pointers on how to improve it. I asked it to be ~mean~critic so as you'll see, it has a lot to say on how to give even better talks :)

Speaking of App, if you're wondering who I am, have a look at my "[AI-powered resume](https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1VRVKZ8qFAG6Rgc1np3u8g5eBgbmI9094?fullscreenApplet=true)".

> **Note:** For older talks I just shared the video recording as the slides are already outdated, and as a general rule, these deck of slides will very quickly be outdated as the genAI world is a very fast evolving environement.

## Other useful repos

* I'm the main contributer and maintainer of the [Gemini cookbook](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook) where you can fing all sort of code sameples to get started with the Gemini API. It's mostly Python but this is simple enough for you to grasp what's happening even if you don't know python.
* I'm also part of the maintenaners of these system instructions in the [Python](https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai/blob/main/codegen_instructions.md) and the [Javascript](https://github.com/googleapis/js-genai/blob/main/codegen_instructions.md), that you can use to teach any LLM how to use the Gemini API.
* Finally I started a "[Vibe-coding challenge](https://github.com/Giom-V/vibe-coding-challenge)". The goal was to share a vibe-coded app every week, but it ended up being every month instead.
